#summary Reviewer guide

= Introduction =

Reviewer is a module that provides an easy way to show the ZUL source code on your ZUL page.

This module is useful mostly when you need to review ZUL files with your partners at development stage. We usually don't use this module in a public accessible web application.


= Setup =

 # Download reviewer.jar from [http://code.google.com/p/zk-module/downloads/list here].
 # In your web.xml, add the following lines (to allow Richlets):

{{{
<!-- Module Richlet -->
<servlet-mapping>
	<servlet-name>zkLoader</servlet-name>
	<url-pattern>/mod/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
}}}


= Usage =

Suppose you have the following ZUL page:
{{{
http://localhost:8080/myapp/test/test-01.zul
}}}
Add a segement {{{mod/review}}} after context path,
{{{
http://localhost:8080/myapp/mod/review/test/test-01.zul
}}}
then you can view and download the ZUL source in that page.
